# ISIC2018

This repository makes use of the excellent [segmentation models](https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models) library (based on Keras) to segment skin lesions.
This library exposes 4 primary segmentation models, many pretrained backbone architectures (I count 34!), and a huge number of recommneded loss functions.

Overall, the flexibility of this library opens the door for tons of hyperparameter experiments to find the best architecutes.

### Overall process

1: Performed basic exploration of the dataset in [this notebook](ISIC 2018 EDA.ipynb)
